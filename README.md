# Sympthia-a-healtchare-conversational-agent
Sympthia is a healthcare conversational agent MVP, built on the Google Cloud Platform, designed to provide immediate patient guidance. The agent utilizes an end-to-end data pipeline to ingest anonymized symptom and location data in real-time into Google BigQuery. This data warehouse directly feeds a dynamic Looker Studio dashboard, which provides live, interactive visualizations of public health trends. The project showcases a modern, cloud-based approach to transforming raw user input into actionable business and public health intelligence.
